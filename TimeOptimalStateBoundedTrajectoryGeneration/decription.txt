'test_piece_wise_traj.m' is the realization of 'On-Line Planning of Time-Optimal, Jerk-Limited Trajectories', the idea was first we have 2nd order pos traj with end state pos=0,vel=0 with bounded acc, then this traj can be treated as 2nd order vel traj with end state vel=0,acc=0 with bounded jerk, then the pos traj as a result will be third order. We concatenate two 2nd order vel profiles, the first one(acc phase) is vel increase to v_max, acc to 0, the second one(dec phase) is vel decrease to 0, acc to 0, then the total acc profile can be at most split into 6 phases. And if the pos is not reached, then we can add a cruising phase in the middle;otherwise if pos is overshoot, we have to reduce cruise vel(or equally reduce acc phase duration).
